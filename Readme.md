#Evernote Notebook Picker
This is a simple UI wrapper for user to pick one of notebooks from his/her Evernote accounts. 
For a Evernote heavy user, he/she will have lots of notebook. A traditional notebook picker with a simple table view isn't efficient. But this notebook picker will stack the notebooks based on user's notebook and stack hierarchy, and also provide a search function to search by keywords. 

It is still in early development. Welcome to join me to give it more functions.
